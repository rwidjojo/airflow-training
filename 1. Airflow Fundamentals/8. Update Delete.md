# 8. Update and Delete

## 8.1 Update DAG and Task

As long not edit DAG id or Task id component updated is no problem just update directly on file DAG

Add new task is okay, but avoid delete existing task. Because if task deleted then old task history will be orphaned and will difficult to find.

If you must delete the task, then better choice is create new DAG then turn off old DAG

## 8.2 Delete DAG

Delete DAG could be done through web UI. But DAG record will be there until you delete actual DAG file
