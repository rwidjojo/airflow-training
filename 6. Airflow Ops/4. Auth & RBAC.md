# Authentication & RBAC

Airflow has built in authentication and role based acces control (rbac)

## Fresh Setup

If you just getting new Airflow installation then open file `airflow.cfg` in the section `[webserver]` find setting `authenticate` and set its value to `True` then add key `rbac` and `auth_backend`

```bash
# Set to true to turn on authentication:
# https://airflow.apache.org/security.html#web-authentication
authenticate = True
rbac = True
auth_backend = airflow.contrib.auth.backends.password_auth
```

save file and start Airflow.

if you open Airflow Web UI then you will see

### Create Admin User

For initial setup you will need to create Admin account so you can login first and create another account afterwards

to create new user head to command line interface then paste:

```bash
airflow create_user --role Admin --username admin --email admin@airflow.org --password admin --firstname admin --lastname admin
```

- `--role` must be `Admin` so you will have full access to airflow UI
- other configs such as `--username` etc adjust it as required

Validate user created by command

```bash
airflow list_users
```

## Update From Previous Setup

If you want to use previously setup airflow then after your configure `airflow.cfg`, update your metadata database to new config by command

```bash
airflow upgradedb
```

Then create admin User.

## Docker Setup

Copy yaml file `LocalExecutor.yaml` from [previous section](1.%20LocalExecutor%20Installation.md) and give name `AirflowAuth.yaml`

### Configuration

Because we don't have direct access to `airflow.cfg` file, Airflow also provide configuration through environment variables.

Then convention environment variable names is `AIRFLOW__[SECTION]__[CONFIG_KEY]`. Pay attention that between `AIRFLOW`, `[SECTION]` and `[CONFIG_KEY]` is double underscore `__` not single `_`. Also use **upper case** on all character

For example if in `airflow.cfg` like this

```bash
[core]
dags_folder = /home/ubuntu/airflow/dags
base_log_folder = /home/ubuntu/airflow/logs
remote_logging = True
```

You could see that section is `[core]` and configuration key is `dags_folder`, `base_log_folder` and `remote_logging`. So if we want to configure from environment variables we could declare

```bash
export AIRFLOW__CORE__DAGS_FOLDER=/home/ubuntu/airflow/dags
export AIRFLOW__CORE__BASE_LOG_FOLDER=/home/ubuntu/airflow/logs
export AIRFLOW__CORE__REMOTE_LOGGING=True
```

or if in this case we need configure section `[webserver]` with key `authenticate`, `rbac` and `auth_backend`. Then environment variables we need is

```bash
export AIRFLOW__WEBSERVER__AUTHENTICATE=True
export AIRFLOW__WEBSERVER__RBAC=True
export AIRFLOW__WEBSERVER__AUTH_BACKEND=airflow.contrib.auth.backends.password_auth
```

So you could passed that environment variables to docker compose.

Open your file `AirflowAuth.yaml` service `webserver` on `environment` key add that variables. for example

```yaml
environment:
  - LOAD_EX=n
  - EXECUTOR=Local
  - AIRFLOW__WEBSERVER__AUTHENTICATE=True
  - AIRFLOW__WEBSERVER__RBAC=True
  - AIRFLOW__WEBSERVER__AUTH_BACKEND=airflow.contrib.auth.backends.password_auth
```

save your file and close.

Start your docker compose

```bash
docker-compose -f AirflowAuth.yaml up -d
```

### Create User

Because we can't access `airflow` command outside docker container, then we need to go inside to be able access that.

First we execute service `webserver` with `/bin/bash`

```bash
docker-compose -f local_executor.yaml exec webserver /bin/bash
```

Then we need to define SQL Alchemy Connecton string because docker image [`puckel/docker-airflow:1.10.9`](<(https://hub.docker.com/r/puckel/docker-airflow)>) does not expose it.

```bash
export AIRFLOW__CORE__SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN=postgresql+psycopg2://airflow:airflow@postgres:5432/airflow
```

Then create admin user and verify it

```bash
airflow create_user --role Admin --username admin --email admin@airflow.org --password admin --firstname admin --lastname admin
airflow list_users
```

## Users and Roles

After you login to web UI Interface there will be new menu `Security`

<img src="./imgs/3_security.png"/>

And there are some pages that needed to know about Auth and RBAC

### List Users

Open menu `Security` > `List Users`

<img src="./imgs/4_list_users.png"/>

This page is place you manage (create, list, edit and delete) users.

### List Roles

Open menu `Security` > `List Roles`

<img src="./imgs/5_list_roles.png"/>

This page is place you manage (create, list, edit and delete) roles.

**Notes: Recommended do not edit default roles provided by Airflow, better create new role if you need different set of permissions**

`Admin` can create a set of roles which are only allowed to view a certain set of dags. This is called DAG level access. Each dag defined in the dag model table is treated as a `View` which has two permissions associated with it (`can_dag_read` and `can_dag_edit`). There is a special view called `all_dags` which allows the role to access all the dags. The default `Admin`, `Viewer`, `User`, `Op` roles can all access `all_dags` view.

### User Profile

Open menu user on the navbar right corner, menu name is different based on `Firstname` and `Lastname` in my case is `admin admin` > `Profile`

<img src="./imgs/6_profile.png"/>

In this page you could view detail, edit and reset password your own user
