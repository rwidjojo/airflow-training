# 16. Challenges

Create your own DAG with specification

1. schedule interval is every 4 days, so DAG will be running each 4 days.
2. Start date is 5 days ago
3. There are 4 task `greet_task`, `get_prev_exec`, `get_next_exec` and `calc_interval`
4. `greet_task` is just show greeting message using BashOperator
5. `get_prev_exec` using PythonOperator get previous execution date and show it then pass to xcomm
6. `get_next_exec` using PythonOperator get next execution date and show it then pass to xcomm
7. `calc_interval` is get xcomm from `get_prev_exec` and `get_next_exec` then calculate duration between prev execution date and next execution date
8. Task dependency:

```
                   ->  get_prev_exec
                  /                 \
greet_task                     calc_interval
                  \                 /
                   -> get_next_exec
```
