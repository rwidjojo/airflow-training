# 20. Challenges

### Incremental with Interval

Based on `lesson4.exercise1.py` create new DAG with specs:

- DAG run each 2 day
- Instead of count daily order change to count 2 day order.

### Dummy Branching

Create DAG with tasks

- greet_task => task that say hello
- branching_task => task that decide flow where DAG run
- branch_odd_task => task that only run when `execution_date` is odd number
- branch_even_task => task that only run when `execution_date` is even number
- odd_process_task => task that run after `branch_odd_task` finished
- curr_date_task => task that run after `odd_process_task` or `branch_even_task` and print current execution date
- final_task => task that run after `curr_date_task` and log that dag is success.
- is_latest_task => task that check if execution date is latest run
- notif_task => dummy notification that DAG has run successfully and only run `is_latest_task` running successfully

Free use any operators, and free to log anything. most important is able to compose branching and condition
